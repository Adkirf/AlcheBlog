What are soulbound tokens?
In summary, soulbound tokens (SBTs) are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that, once minted to the individual, cannot be transferred or sold. So how did we get this definition
_____________________________________


The origination of soulbound tokens is popularly attributed to a blog post by Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin which was then expanded on in a follow-up paper between Buterin and other contributors. In his blog, Buterin first describes the concept of “soulbound” as something that remains in the individual’s possession unable to be transferred or sold. Tracing the idea back to World of Warfract game mechanics, Buterin notes that soulbound items in the game enter the player’s possession upon the completion of a hard or risky task. In the game this keeps things interesting , however the concept’s importance expands to blockchain as well where tools to minimize rent seeking behavior are always in vogue. Rent seeking behavior involves individuals providing minimal value as a whole but slowly accumulating capital to gain power and it is problematic for blockchain networks and game mechanics alike. As in game mechanics, this behavior is detrimental to blockchains as individuals provides little value over but slwoly accumulates capital and eventually just purchases the item. While for World of Warcraft this capital are items and this power are particulary potent items, for blockchain network capital is captured in tokens and power is conferred in monetary, governance, and other forms. So Buterin’s blog naturally transitions to talking about tokens, specifically non-fungible tokens (NFTs). He introduces cases in which the transferability of NFTs is illogical. For example, the proof of attendance protocol (POAP) where individuals are minted NFTs to prove they were present at a particular event. Some projects tried to utilize these POAP NFTs to provide exclusive opportunities which gave them monetary value which of course meant that a market quickly formed to sell them to the highest bidder. Now one of these NFTs is sitting in someone’s wallet for an event they never attende
