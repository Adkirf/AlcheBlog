The Polygon network is a collection of protocols designed to fix Ethereumâ€™s network challenges by handling transactions on a separate Ethereum-compatible blockchain. Polygon then returns the processed transactions to the main Ethereum blockchain. This then allows Polygon to lower the network congestion on the main chain, speed up transactions, and lower costs.

Polygon allows up to 7,000 transactions per second and service fees which usually moves between $0.0005 and $0.2.

This chain is a separate blockchain that is attached to Ethereum using a two-way peg. The two-way peg enables the interchangeability of assets between Ethereum and Polygon.
