The world of Ethereum is expanding rapidly, and with it, the need for efficient and scalable blockchain solutions. This is where Polygon comes in, playing the role of the friendly neighborhood Spiderman. Just like Spiderman, Polygon has adapted and evolved to suit the ecosystem’s needs.

Fighting the Villans
There is no superhero without villains and in the same way, we can’t have spiderman without Mysterio. In our case, it is non-scalability. Before we understand how it fights with this superpower let us understand our Villian — Nonscalability

Scalability is the power to maintain the same functionality when there is an increase in demand for the network. So blockchain should be able to handle a large number of transactions. Currently, Ethereum can handle only 7 to 15 transactions per second(TPS) whereas its centralized counterparts can handle up to 1000 transactions per second.

But the question may arise why can’t we ask politely the villain to have change of a heart why do we have to fight it? Well, the answer lies in the design of the Ethereum chain. Any blockchain has based on three pillars — decentralization, security, and scalability. Ethereum focuses more on Decentralisation and Security and makes it extremely slow.

Swinging into Action
Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, was created in 2017 to provide a scalable and high-performance infrastructure for Ethereum. Since then, it has grown to become a full-f
